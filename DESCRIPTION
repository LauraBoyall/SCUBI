Description: The SCUBIDO package (Simulating Climate Using Bayesian Inference 
    with proxy Data Observations) uses XRF core scanning proxy data from lake 
    sediments and transforms this data into a quantitative climate reconstruction.
    This approach uses Bayesian inference for the reconstruction and requires a 
    calibration period which includes an overlapping period of instrumental climate
    data e.g. temperature. The relationship between the XRF core scanning data
    and the climate timeseries is expressed through a likelihood function. We then 
    use Bayesian inference to combine this likelihood function with priors to extract
    a climate reconstruction for the rest of the XRF core scanning data sequene.
